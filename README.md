<b>Hardware Product Financial Model</b> - Used to calculate return on investment (ROI), internal rate of return (IRR), net present value (NPV), cash flows, monthly recurring revenue (MRR) and total contract value (TCV) in order to gauge value of project, and determine if project makes sense with business objectives.

  Financials model inputs are;
- Capital cost to deploy a hardware product
- Time in months to deploy a hardware product
- Customer term in months, model reflects the difference in value created over six termed options (1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years and 20 years)
- Customer upfront/capex payment for hardware product
- Customer monthly/opex payment for hardware product

<b>Product Brief: Business to Business (B2B) New Feature Launch</b>

Cloud Freeze, is a cloud infrastructure company. A new feature launch, branded Synergy, allows developers to leverage demographic public government data (state and local). Cloud Freeze has the technology in place. The team needs to reengineer how to deploy these services in under 24 hours.

<b>Objective:</b> To reengineer how to deploy the feature in under 24 hours. 

<b>Metric #1: Increase Interest</b>
How will we measure?
- Average session length
- Top exit page
- Pages per Session

<b>Metric #2: Increase Adoption</b>
How will we measure?
- Number of existing Cloud Freeze users who sign up for Synergy
- Number of new account creations
- Number of Trial Purchases

<b>Hypothesis:</b> The creation of a new automation sign up process, will result in deployment time of under 24 hours. 

<b>MVP:</b> The creation of a new automation sign up process for Synergy, using a Wizard of Oz MVP, will allow Cloud Freeze to deploy the feature in under 4 hours, increase operational efficiency, reduce human error, lower operating costs, and create a higher return on investment for Synergy.

<b>Balsamiq Wireframes</b>

A Wizard of Oz MVP is one of the fastest and most effective ways of testing hypotheses as to whether proposed solutions will create value for customers. While this will happen automatically from a customer perspective, it will be managed manually in the background. Below are a handful of the proposed wireframes for the Wizard of Oz app creation;
