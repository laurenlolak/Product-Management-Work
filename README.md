# Hootsuite - Scheduling Social Media Posts
<b>Halloween Event Marketing Campaign</b>

This Halloween Campaign was created for a Small B2C Events company, hosting a unique haunted house adventure occuring October 30th, 31st and Novemeber 1st 2020. The post's were scheduled in advance via the Hootsuite publisher function. Posting times, for each day, were set based on the time of day when engagement is highest on each platform. 

For Instragram the times vary. The Instagram posts were set up at the below optimal time of day;
- Monday: 11am
- Tuesday: 10am
- Wednesday: 11am
- Thursday: 10am
- Friday: 11am
- Saturday: 9am, 10am and 11am
- Sunday: 8am

For Facebook, the window for B2C is between 9-10am, 12-1pm and 4-5pm daily. Originally we elected for posts at 5pm; however, after reviewing the engagement stats from the first week of the campaign, I altered the Facebook posts schedule around 12pm.

# Product School Project - Balsamiq Wireframing Examples

<b>Product Brief: Business to Business (B2B) New Feature Launch</b>

<b>Objective:</b> The teams objective was to reengineer how to deploy the feature in under 4 hours. 
<b>Hypothesis:</b> The creation of a new automation sign up process, will result in deployment time of under 24 hours. 
<b>MVP:</b> The creation of a new automation sign up process for Synergy, using a Wizard of Oz MVP, will allow Cloud Freeze to deploy the feature in under 4 hours, increase operational efficiency, reduce human error, lower operating costs, and create a higher return on investment for Synergy.

While this will hapen automatically from a customer perspective, it will be managed manually in the background. Below are a handful of the proposed wireframes for the Wizard of Oz app creation;
