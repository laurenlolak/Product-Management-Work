 <b>White Paper: 6 Things Every CTO Must Know About Future-Proofing Communications</b>

The events of early 2020 have changed the world, and the workplace. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic there has been an unprecedented, and necessary, shift to work-from-home. In response, may organizations were forced to rapidly adapt, adopt new tools, and invest in cap-ex heavy location agnostic devices, technology and user management solutions. The implementation of these impromptu solutions introduced substantial new security risks, and user management challenges, placing unanticipated strain on IT, administrators and HR.
This white paper examines the shift to mass work-from-home, which  happened rapidly, and caught many companies unprepared; however, the shift to remote work is here to stay, requiring IT and business leaders to consider their strategy for managing a geographically dispersed workforce going forward.

# Marketing Manager Consultation Examples

<b>Hootsuite - Halloween Event Marketing Campaign</b>

This Halloween Campaign was created for a Small B2C Events company, hosting a unique haunted house adventure occurring October 30th, 31st and November 1st 2020.The strategy was;
-	Set clear expectations regarding the customer experience during the event.
-	Write a compelling narrative that creates interest by pulling the reader into the storyline.
-	Product positioning, highlighting the unique aspects to differentiate the event in comparison to competing Halloween events such as PNE’s Fright Nights. 

The posts were scheduled in advance via the Hootsuite publisher function. Posting times, for each day, were set based on the time of day when engagement is highest on each platform. For Instagram the times vary. The Instagram posts were set up at the below optimal time of day.

For Facebook, the window for B2C is between 9-10am, 12-1pm and 4-5pm daily. Originally we elected for posts at 5pm; however, after reviewing the engagement stats from the first week of the campaign, I altered the Facebook schedule to post between 11am and 12pm.
